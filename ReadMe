= BloomFilter

BloomFilter -- A class for making bloomfilters

== Synopsis

  #!/usr/bin/ruby -w
  require 'bloomfilter'
  bf = BloomFilter.new(1000, 0.01) # 1000 keys, 1% false-positives
  bf.add("foo")
  puts "Yup" if bf.has?("foo")

== Requirements

* Ruby 1.8

=== Recommended:

* BitSet -- C extension availabe on the RAA
  (http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/bitset/)
  
BloomFilter will try to load BitSet and if that fails it will fall back to
an included, but limited/slower SimpleVector library -- this included slow
library is not suitable for anything more than just playing around.
